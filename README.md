# Procedural-Terrain-Generation-OpenGL


Real-time Procedural Terrain Generation developed in C++/OpenGL, capable of generating infinite terrains using multifractal models based on Fractal Brownian Motion and Perlin Noise. It incorporates Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), image-based lighting (IBL) for enhanced realism, an HDR skybox for a dynamic and immersive sky, and volumetric fog rendering to create depth and atmospheric effects.
