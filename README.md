# Procedural-Terrain-Generation-OpenGL

Real-time Procedural Terrain Generation developed in C++/OpenGL, featuring multifractal terrain models generated with Fractal Brownian Motion and Perlin Noise. It uses Physically-Based Rendering (PBR), image-based lighting (IBL) for enhanced realism, an HDR skybox for a dynamic and immersive sky, and volumetric fog rendering to create depth and atmospheric effects.
